GoIT Markup Homework #6

Welcome to my sixth homework project for the GoIT Full Stack Course! ðŸŽ¨

Overview: This project builds upon the "Web Studio" website by adding form
elements and modal window functionality based on the homework #5 mockups. It
also focuses on proper semantic HTML, optimized images, and responsive design
using modern CSS techniques.

Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository: git clone
   https://github.com/roman-shugol/goit-markup-hw-06.git

2. Open index.html in your browser.

Project Structure

- index.html: Main HTML file containing the updated page structure.
- css/styles.css: Stylesheet with custom CSS using Flexbox for layout, along
  with responsive design techniques.
- images/: Directory containing optimized images and SVG sprite (icons.svg).
- modern-normalize.css: Normalize stylesheet for cross-browser consistency.

Key Features:

1. Modal Window: Implemented modal window with a backdrop and centered content.
   The window includes a close button, styled to be in the top-right corner with
   padding and circular design.
2. SVG Icons: All vector icons are stored in an optimized SVG sprite (icons.svg)
   for better performance.
3. Form Elements: Integrated multiple forms, including a subscription form in
   the footer and a contact form inside the modal window, with semantic HTML and
   proper name attributes.
4. Checkbox Styling: Custom checkbox for accepting terms and conditions using an
   SVG checkmark.
5. Responsive Layout: Ensures the layout adapts to different screen sizes using
   Flexbox and media queries.
6. Hover and Focus Effects: Hover and focus effects applied to form elements,
   including color changes for inputs and icons when focused, as seen in the
   mockup.
7. Optimized Images: All images, including icons, are optimized for faster
   loading and better performance.
8. Semantic HTML: The code adheres to semantic HTML practices for better
   accessibility and SEO.
